# üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Throttling Libraries & Repositories
*Advanced tools to overcome sophisticated website throttling*

## üåü **Recommended Libraries for Advanced Anti-Detection**

### 1. **cloudscraper** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Best for:** Cloudflare and advanced anti-bot bypass
```bash
pip install cloudscraper
```
- Automatically handles Cloudflare challenges
- Built-in browser fingerprint spoofing
- Handles JavaScript challenges automatically
- Works with 99% of Cloudflare-protected sites

### 2. **undetected-chromedriver** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Best for:** Full browser automation that's undetectable
```bash
pip install undetected-chromedriver
```
- Selenium-based but completely undetected
- Real browser sessions with all JS support
- Perfect for sites with advanced detection
- Can handle any website that regular browsers can

### 3. **playwright-stealth** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Best for:** Fast, modern browser automation
```bash
pip install playwright playwright-stealth
```
- Microsoft's browser automation tool
- Built-in stealth features
- Faster than Selenium
- Excellent for modern websites

### 4. **requests-html** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Best for:** JavaScript-enabled requests
```bash
pip install requests-html
```
- Lightweight browser simulation
- JavaScript execution support
- Based on PyQuery and requests

### 5. **httpx with advanced features** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Best for:** Advanced HTTP/2 support with browser-like behavior
```bash
pip install httpx[http2] httpx-caching
```
- HTTP/2 support (more modern than requests)
- Connection pooling and keep-alive
- Better browser simulation

## üîß **Specialized Anti-Detection Tools**

### 6. **curl_cffi** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Best for:** Perfect cURL browser impersonation
```bash
pip install curl-cffi
```
- Impersonates real browsers perfectly
- TLS fingerprint matching
- HTTP/2 support
- Extremely hard to detect

### 7. **tls-client** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Best for:** Advanced TLS fingerprinting
```bash
pip install tls-client
```
- Perfect browser TLS fingerprints
- JA3 fingerprint spoofing
- Works with most anti-bot systems

### 8. **FlareSolverr** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Best for:** Cloudflare challenge solving service
```bash
# Docker service that solves challenges
docker run --rm -p 8191:8191 ghcr.io/flaresolverr/flaresolverr:latest
```
- Dedicated service for solving challenges
- Works with any programming language
- Handles complex JavaScript challenges

## üéØ **Best Solution for Your ROM Downloader**

Based on your throttling pattern (fast for 30-60s, then slow), I recommend:

### **Option 1: cloudscraper + curl_cffi (Recommended)**
```python
import cloudscraper
from curl_cffi import requests as curl_requests

# Combination approach
session = cloudscraper.create_scraper()
# or
session = curl_requests.Session(impersonate="chrome110")
```

### **Option 2: undetected-chromedriver (Most Effective)**
```python
import undetected_chromedriver as uc
from selenium import webdriver

# Real browser session
driver = uc.Chrome()
# Download ROMs through real browser
```

### **Option 3: Session Rotation with curl_cffi**
```python
# Rotate complete browser sessions every few downloads
# Each session has different fingerprint
```

## üì¶ **Quick Integration Script**

I can create a **"Phase 4 Enhanced Downloader"** that integrates one of these libraries with your existing infrastructure. Which approach interests you most?

1. **cloudscraper integration** (easiest)
2. **curl_cffi integration** (most effective for requests)
3. **undetected-chromedriver** (most effective overall, but slower)
4. **Custom session rotation** with advanced fingerprinting

## üöÄ **Immediate Action**

Let's implement **cloudscraper** first since it's:
- ‚úÖ Drop-in replacement for requests
- ‚úÖ Handles most anti-bot measures automatically
- ‚úÖ Minimal code changes needed
- ‚úÖ Proven track record

Would you like me to create an enhanced ROM downloader using one of these libraries?
