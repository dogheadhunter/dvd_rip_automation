- **Multiple proxy sources** (GitHub, API endpoints)
- **All ProxyBroker functionality** without compatibility issues

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Basic Scraping (No Proxies)
```powershell
# 1. Use the sample URLs or create your own
python simple_web_scraper.py

# Follow prompts:
# - URL file: sample_urls.txt (or your file)
# - Output dir: downloads (or your choice)
# - Confirm: y
```

### For Advanced Scraping (With Proxies)
```powershell
# 1. Run the advanced scraper
python free_proxy_scraper.py

# Follow prompts:
# - URL file: sample_urls.txt
# - Output dir: downloads
# - Use proxies: y (for proxy rotation) or n (for direct)
# - Proxy count: 20 (recommended)
# - Confirm: y
```

## 📝 URL File Format

Create a text file with URLs (one per line):
```
# ROM sites (example)
https://coolrom.com.au/roms/gc/
https://romsmania.cc/roms/gamecube

# News sites
https://example-news.com/tech
https://blog-site.com/articles

# Comments start with #
# Empty lines are ignored
```

## 📊 What Gets Downloaded

For each URL, the scraper creates:
- `{domain}_{path}.txt` - Page title and text content
- `{domain}_{path}_links.txt` - All links found on the page
- `scraper.log` - Detailed activity log

- `proxy_count`: 20 - Number of proxies to fetch (proxy version)

## 📁 Example File Structure After Scraping

```
downloads/
├── httpbin.org__ip.txt

## 🚨 ProxyBroker Integration Issue EXPLAINED

### **The Problem:**
- **ProxyBroker 0.3.2** was last updated in **2018** 
- Uses deprecated `asyncio.Queue(loop=...)` syntax
- **Python 3.8+** (2019) removed the `loop` parameter 
- **Current Python 3.13** completely incompatible

### **The Error:**
```
TypeError: Queue.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'loop'
```

### **The Fix:**
Created `modern_proxy_scraper.py` with:
- ✅ **Modern asyncio patterns** (no loop parameter)
- ✅ **aiohttp for async HTTP** requests
- ✅ **Concurrent proxy testing** 
- ✅ **Multiple proxy sources** (GitHub repos, APIs)
- ✅ **Same functionality** as ProxyBroker without compatibility issues
