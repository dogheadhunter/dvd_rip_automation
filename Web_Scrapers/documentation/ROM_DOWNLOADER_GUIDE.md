**⚠️ Warning**: Large collections require significant disk space and bandwidth!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No ROM files found"**
- Make sure you've run the ROM website scraper first
- Check that `rom_website_scraper/scraped_data/` exists

**"Timeout errors"**
- Large files may need longer timeouts
- Check your internet connection
- Try with fewer concurrent downloads

**"Proxy errors"**
- The system will find working proxies automatically
- If all proxies fail, it will attempt direct downloads

### Performance Tips

1. **Start small**: Test with `GC_games_final.txt` first
2. **Monitor disk space**: Large collections need TB of storage  
3. **Use good internet**: Stable connection recommended
4. **Be patient**: Large files take time even with proxies
