### **File Structure**
```
Web_Scrapers/
├── scraper_launcher.py          # Main menu (includes ROM downloader)
├── rom_downloader.py            # ROM download engine
├── working_scrapers/
│   └── modern_proxy_scraper.py  # Proxy system used by ROM downloader
└── documentation/
    └── ROM_DOWNLOADER_GUIDE.md  # Usage instructions
```

### **Dependencies Added**
- `aiohttp` - Async HTTP requests
- `aiofiles` - Async file operations
- All requirements updated in `requirements.txt`

## 📊 Expected Performance

### **Download Speeds**
- With proxies: 1-10 MB/s (varies by proxy)
- Direct connection: 5-50 MB/s (varies by internet)
- GameCube ROMs: ~100MB-1.5GB each

### **Reliability Features**
- **Resume capability**: Large files can be resumed if interrupted
- **Timeout protection**: 5-minute timeout per file prevents hanging
- **Error recovery**: Failed downloads are logged and can be retried
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time progress updates every 10MB

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test with small collection**: Start with `GC_games_final.txt` (46 ROMs)
2. **Monitor disk space**: Ensure adequate storage for your chosen collection
3. **Check download location**: Files save to `ROM_Downloads/` by default
4. **Verify proxy performance**: System will show working proxy count
5. **Scale up**: Move to larger collections once comfortable

## 🛡️ Safety & Legal Notes

- **Proxy rotation** helps avoid IP blocking
- **Rate limiting** prevents overwhelming servers
- **Resume capability** reduces wasted bandwidth
- **Error handling** prevents incomplete downloads
